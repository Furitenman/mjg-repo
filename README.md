# [/mjg/ Repository](https://repo.riichi.moe)

maajan repo for the maajan general. pls apply as repoanons, thanks. ~~No seriously, everybody is dead~~there's people now, but help is still needed.

something wrong with repo? submit it in issues or in the [site feedback](https://repo.riichi.moe/feed.html). or post it in the thread, i'll read it. and update it as fast as possible.

If you want your own article, you found something mahjong related, you made something, push it. I don't care how shady you are. It's probably the only way to change the repo properly without a tourney win.

# to do
- misc pages with lots of useful tools don't ask me yet what this means
- rb1 vn (for real this time) (check this at the vn folder)
- akochan lewd dumps somewhere, if you click the lucky link, you get a random akochan being ronned by old men for points
- let me play tsukihime on the browser

\>noooo you have to put it in the issues\
these aren't issues these are DREAMS
