  <h1 id="watm">What exactly is Mahjong?</h1>
  <p>Mahjong is a   tile-based game most similar to a cross between Gin Rummy and Poker.  It   was originally created in China, but the popularity spread quickly, and   nearly every single area in Asia has its own variant. </p>
  <p>This pastebin is focused solely on the Japanese variation, most commonly known as "Riichi" or "Reach" Mahjong.</p>

  <h1 id="howplay">How do I play?  What are the rules?</h1>
  <p>Here was some various links to the rules.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://mahjong.guide/a-beginners-guide-to-riichi-mahjong/">A Beginner's Guide to Riichi Mahjong</a></strong></p>
  <p>A   web guide to learning Riichi Mahjong.  Includes handy links and   pictures as well.  Generally an all around good resource.  It is not   fully comprehensive, though, and is essentially a very brief "how to   play video games/online".  Once you brush up over those, if you find   your knowledge lacking, or you really really like the game, you should   definitely read up on the other rulesets there.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://mjg-repo.neocities.org/pastebin/how-to-play-video-game-mahjong.html">Fast and dirty guide to playing video game Mahjong from a /v/-anon</a></strong></p>
  <p>This   is an incredibly short read and should teach you just enough to be a   threat to someone while playing in a video game version, such as in   Yakuza.  You shouldn't rely on this as there is a lot, lot more to   learn, but this isn't bad for a fast method.</p>

  <p><a href="http://mahjong-europe.org/portal/"><strong>European Mahjong Association (EMA)</strong></a></p>
  <p>The   EMA is the official tournament rules for Riichi Mahjong in the Europe   area.  They also tend to be the most popular ruleset to reference when   people translate the game due to various factors.  The rules here are   more focused on tournament play, and thus will skip over various rules   that you may see in other games.</p>

  <p><a href="https://worldriichi.org/"><strong>World Riichi Competition (WRC)</strong></a></p>
  <p>The   WRC is an attempt to standardize the English-speaker rules for Riichi   Mahjong in tournament settings.  It is not usually as popular as EMA,   but will sometimes be referenced.  The rules here are more focused on   tournament play, and thus will skip over various rules that you may see   in other games.</p>

This is meant for more   advanced players who just want a quick list of differences between their   chosen variant versus other official leagues.  Please note, even if you   are advanced, it is still best to view the most updated rules before   playing.</p>

  <h1 id="wherep">Where to play the game solo and practice?</h1>
  <h2>Browser</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/mahjong/mahjong_e.html"><strong>"That flash game"</strong></a></p>
  <p>Best place to practice for beginners.  Very simple.  Has a list of Yaku on the page as well.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="http://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/bamboo/bamboo.html"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a></p>
  <p>This   is a single-suit variant.  This will give your brain a very intense   workout.  Definitely not recommended for beginners still learning the   game, but included for advanced players looking to become better.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://euophrys.itch.io/mahjong-efficiency-trainer"><strong>Efficiency trainer</strong></a></p>
  <p>A   simple app to help you work on your efficiency in discards.  The app is   simplistic and doesn't take a holistic view of the table.  Rather, it   merely measures how efficient your discard is by how many tiles it   believes would improve your hand to tenpai, and nothing else.  You have   great efficiency if you can consistently score 95% or higher on this   over several attempts.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://mahjong.org/training/training_002/"><strong>Chinitsu Wait Trainer</strong></a> (new) </p>
  <p>Similar   to Bamboo listed above, but the page is entirely in Japanese. Just   follow the guide written by an anon below and you'll be fine.</p>
  <p>Blue   button generates new hand and orange button shows answers. Top left   determines number of tiles: either 7, 10, or 13. Below that is sorted or   unsorted (sorted by default). Top right determines the suit (manzu by   default) </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>PC</h2>
  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/338060/Mahjong_Pretty_Girls_Battle/"><strong>Mahjong Pretty Girls Battle</strong></a></p>
  <p>Don't   laugh.  While the prettyness of the girls is debatable, as well as the   translation choices, this is a full Mahjong variant and a good way to   practice.  Comes with a billion rules which can be adjusted as well.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/791500/Mahjong_Riichi_Multiplayer/"><strong>Mahjong Riichi Multiplayer</strong></a></p>
  <p>Mentioned   only for completeness sake, it had a big ambition, but was rather   buggy, of low quality, and has no players for online.  The tutorial   included in it was so-so.  However, it seems to have had several updates   that reportedly fixed many bugs.  Not sure if recommended or not.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="http://www.unbalance.co.jp/honkaku/smahjong3d/"><strong>Saikyo no Mahjong 3D</strong></a></p>
  <p>A   very cute but effective solo game for the PC that will run on toasters.    You can select the different AI who will operate slightly differently.    There IS an English version available to download SOMEWHERE, but it's   patched, pirated, and easy to find.  Downloading the old 2007 software   would be illegal, anon.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/912370/Mahjong_Club/"><strong>Mahjong Club</strong></a> (new) </p>
  <p>It's   Saki the PC game, complete with interhigh tournaments, superpowers and   cute girls. The superpowers can be turned off to make it a completely   normal mahjong game, thankfully. It's the nicest looking (not the tiles,   those are ugly) single-player pc game in steam out there.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/japanese-mah-jongg-switch"><strong>Japanese Mah Jongg</strong></a></p>
  <p>While   they use the very questionable choice of the American variant's   spelling, Japanese Mah Jongg is Riichi Mahjong, and while very simple   and barebones, is an excellent way to practice against computers. </p>
  <p>Additionally,   it features a two-player split screen mode, with amusing and cute   instructions to cut out a piece of cardboard to prevent screen-looking.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>PS4</h2>
  <p><strong>Yakuza 0</strong></p>
  <p>The   English version of Yakuza 0 retains it's Mahjong side game that used to   be taken out in previous editions of the series.  It is a likely place   where some new comers may join in from.  The rest of the game has little   to do with Mahjong, though it does come recommended.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Android </h2>
  <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ishihata_tech.android.mj2&hl=en_US"><strong>Maujong!</strong></a></p>
  <p>Very simple, free, in english, and has bots.  Supposedly is efficient on the battery.  Somewhat small though.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.hangame.s_mahjong"><strong>麻雀 天極牌 (Mahjong Tenkyokupai)</strong></a></p>
  <p>Really   fun multiplayer mahjong that has offline and online, as well as a   special 2 player mode where you can connect online with one other person   and the other two positions are filled with bots.  However, despite   being offered on the English play store, the game is fully 100% in   Japanese, and there seem to be no English guides.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kemonomahjong.app&hl=en_US"><strong>Kemono Mahjong</strong></a> (new) </p>
  <p>If   the furry aesthetics doesn't make you do a 180 degree turn, or if   you're a dirty Wanjirou main, then the app is not that bad. It's <strong>not free</strong> and there's no working apk floating around, so only mentioned for   completeness' sake. Don't get it unless you're desperate for mahjong   action and furshit.</p>

  <p>Japanese rooms: <a href="https://game.mahjongsoul.com/" target="_blank">https://game.mahjongsoul.com/</a></p>
  <p>A   Chinese-made Riichi Mahjong game that recently came out for English and   Japanese as well.  The interface is fairly stylish, the music is pretty   good, and it allows you to spam emotes from kawaii waifus.  There is a   gacha game attached to it so you can change out the waifus and their   outfits, but everything relating to Mahjong itself is free and is   working fairly well.</p>
  <p>For those wondering, the game   seems to be set up so that China and English versions play together in   the beginner rooms, while Japanese play separate.  After you rank up to   the Gold room or higher, all nations play together.</p>
  <p>There is an app version available for Android and iOS, if you're into that.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a href="https://tenhou.net/"><strong>Tenhou</strong></a></p>
  <p>This   is generally where most of the serious players tend to wind up.

The English UI only works for the HTML5 version of the game which can   be found at tenhou.net/3/.

  <p><strong>SegaMJ.net</strong></p>
  <p>Also   a flashy game made by Sega.  Requires a client install.  Also has a   phone version, but may require side-loading an app.  Game is fully in   Japanese.  Guide for install here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mjnetguide/" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/mjnetguide/

  <p><strong>Janryuumon - DEFUNCT</strong></p>
  <p>An   old client-based online app.  It was free-to-play, but then turned into   pay-to-play during an update and almost all of the playerbase dried up   overnight.  Only mentioning because the P2P version can still be found   in a search for Mahjong.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.</p>

  <p>Japan   has parlors where you can go in and play pickup games of Mahjong, but   the Japanese are not foreigner/otaku friendly.  Be sure to read the   above link for more information, and in fact you should probably spend   at least 16 hours researching before heading in.</p>

  <p>A   map of the /mjg/ anons in the thread. Not a very extensive list, and   some of them aren't accurate locations (like that one penguin), but if   you're very desperate for a mahjong buddy then try looking for an anon   near your area. But most likely you won't find one due to fear of   stabbings. </p>

  <h1 id="count">Counting Points</h1>
  <p>This   is one of the more tedious parts of mahjong. Of course counting points   is automatically done for you in video games, but it's still an   essential thing to learn for players wanting to get into the game   seriously. Not only does it help you save face in irl games, you can   also calculate what kind of hand you must get for that comeback. <a href="https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks/"><strong>Riichi Book 1</strong></a> has a good section on scoring techniques so go check that out first.</p>
