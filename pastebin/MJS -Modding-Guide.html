  <p>By using mjs+ you can pratically replace every single thing in   the client, going from meme mods to poorfagging """premium""" .png.</p>
  <p>Mods   are divided in resourcepacks (replacing audio or pictures) and   extensions (running javascript code). Download one of each from the   repository to look at them. </p>
  <p>Mods are stored in the   MJS+ folder, under either "extension" or "resourcepack" folders. They   are nothing more than a folder, containing at least these files:</p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>extension/resourcepack .json, depending on which type</li>
    <li>preview image</li>
    <li>script.js/assets folder</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>extension.json, or resourcepack.json</strong></p>
  <p>This file contains the basic mod info.</p>
  <p>This is the template:  </p>
  <p>
    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/3CiQMLZq"></script>
  </p>
  <p>If you want to only replace files, use only resourcepack line, and make a "resourcepack" mod.</p>
  <p>If you want to only run a script, use only entry line, and make a "extension" mod.</p>
  <p>If you want both, write both, but you must make an "extension" mod.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>preview image</strong></p>
  <p>Nothing much to say, it's shown in the starting client</p>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>script.js and assets folder</strong></p>
  <p>If   your .json has the line  "entry": "script.js", script.js is the code   that will be run. Sadly, I don't know JS, and the only thing I can do is   modify other people scripts.</p>
  <p>If your .json has the   lines "resourcepack: ...", the assets folder is where you'll place the   files that will overwrite MJS standard ones.</p>
  <p>The original files are stored in the MJS+ folder, under static/2/v.06.xxx/</p>
  <p>2 should stand for EN server, so if you play in chink it could be 0 or 1.</p>
  <p>v.06.xxx   is the version in which that file was first used, so while most of the   files are under the lowest version number, newer things (like files for   events) are under newer folders.</p>
  <p>Now search inside   the folder for what you wish to replace. Note that most abbreviations   are in english, but things longer than 4 character are usually in chink.</p>
  <p>Assuming the file you want to replace is <code>/static/2/v.06.11/en/myres2/treasurehead/treasure_pic0709.png</code>, you will write in the .json</p>
  <p>
    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/SC3RsgkV"></script>
  </p>
  <p>and   you will place in the assets folder the replacing file, with the same   path (ie idofmod/assets/en/myres2/treasurehead/treasure_pic0709.png).</p>
  <hr>
  <p>If you haven't fucked up, the mod should show in the MJS client, and work when enabled.</p>
  <p>If it doesn't, it probably is something stupid such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>id is different from folder name</li>
    <li>version isn't x.x.x</li>
    <li>comma on the last element of the files to replace in the json</li>
    <li>confused extensions from resourcepacks</li>
    <li>put folders in wrong places</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If it does start but doesn't work in game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>script is wrong</li>
    <li>chinks use different files than the one you're replacing (the v.06.xxx storage convention is hell to go through)</li>
    <li>chinks use 10 different versions of the same files, and you didn't replace them all</li>
    <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>Other things</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>As   of now, there are mods that replace tiles, characters, buttons, audio,   tablecloths and some other things, so take a look to avoid wasting your   time, and take what you need</li>
    <li>you can export/import from MJS client, it just expands/compress the mod folder into a renamed .zip</li>
    <li>there   is tablecloth tool, it will make by itself a resourcepack mod with your   desired tablecloth.png replacing the standard blue one</li>
</ul>
