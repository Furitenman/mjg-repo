  <h1 id="watm">What exactly is Mahjong?</h1>
  <p>Mahjong is a   tile-based game most similar to a cross between Gin Rummy and Poker.  It   was originally created in China, but the popularity spread quickly, and   nearly every single area in Asia has its own variant. </p>
  <p>This pastebin is focused solely on the Japanese variation, most commonly known as "Riichi" or "Reach" Mahjong.</p>

It is not   fully comprehensive, though, and is essentially a very brief "how to   play video games/online".  Once you brush up over those, if you find   your knowledge lacking, or you really really like the game, you should   definitely read up on the other rulesets there.</p>

You have   great efficiency if you can consistently score 95% or higher on this   over several attempts.</p>

Also please note that this is all in Japanese, so   you should be able to understand Japanese Mahjong terms at bare minimum   to really follow along.</p>
